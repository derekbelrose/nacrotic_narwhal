## Why
As much as I love the likes of Podverse, Castamatic and Fountain, I absolutely despise subscription creep. So screw it. I'm going to take a stab at creating a project that is a Podcasting 2.0 compliant (as close to 100% as possible) podcast application that has mobile, desktop and web presence. You will self host it. I will not. I don't care if you wrap a service around it.  I don't want the headache of having customers.

All of this and it'll be Free! Beer, Freedom, of advertising, whatever. 

I might tap into the V4V nature and add an option to stream some sats when you're listening to a podcast.  Opt in, of course.

## Why the name
I have always liked the Canonical naming scheme for Ubuntu. I just wanted to put a darker twist on it. Don't like it? Fork it.
